# Y.A.R.V.I.S.

YARVIS (Yet Another Rather Very Intelligent Sysyem) is a personal assistant, and it is developed in Python.



## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install a few packages.

```bash

pip install pyttsx3
pip install speech_recognition
pip install pywhatkit
pip install yfinance
pip install pyjokes
pip install webbrowser
pip install wikipedia

```


## Usage

At this point, Yarvis knows how to:
- great you
- inform you about the time/date
- opens the default browser of your PC
- plays music on Youtube
- is able to search for exact keyphrases on Wikipedia
- JOKES!
- And it's capable to report the stock price for a few companies 

While you can see the output like the one shown below, Yarvis is listening for your next set of instructions.

```bash

I am still here if you need me, sir.

I did not get that, sir.

I am still here if you need me, sir.

```



## Extra

<i> The name is inspired from the personal assistant from the Iron Man franchise. </i>



## Future Development

Increase the modules that Yarvis has. As tested, he can handle stocks pretty well, we'll include cryptocurrencies allong the prices, as well as the weather.
Currently I am testing a couple of tasks to be completed by Yarvis, which will enable him to help with a few daily repetitive tasks.
